# Timepeice

The challenge was to build an analog clock in the browser with a stopwatch mode.

The project was created with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)

The dependencies require you use Node version `Ë†16.0.0 || >=18.0.0`

To install them run `yarn install`

To spin up a local serve with
Hot Module Replacement run `yarn vite`

View the project at your localhost address`http://127.0.0.1:5173/`

### React + TypeScript + Vite

This application uses a template that provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

To set up a new Vite see [the docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

Essentially, you run the following command:

`yarn create vite <project-name> --react-ts`

The terminal will prompt you through addition configuration.
